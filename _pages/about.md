I am a researcher and lecturer at the Department of Comparative Political Economy at the EUF. My doctoral research focuses on the intersection of higher education policy and labour markets, investigating how technological change affects education systems and labour market dynamics.

My research interests span public policy, growth models, technological change and regional development. I have been a visiting researcher at the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI) and the Ca√±ada Blanch Centre at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

At the EUF, I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Comparative Political Economy.

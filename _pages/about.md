I am a doctoral researcher and lecturer at the Department of Comparative Political Economy at the EUF. My doctoral research focuses on the nexus between higher education policy and labour markets.

My research interests include public policy, growth models, technological change and labour markets. I have been a visiting researcher at the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI) and at the Ca√±ada Blanch Centre at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

At the EUF, I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Comparative Political Economy.
